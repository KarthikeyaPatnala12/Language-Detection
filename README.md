Language Detection using Python
# Language Detection Project

This repository contains code for a language detection project. The project aims to predict the language of a given text input using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a multilingual dataset and implements a supervised learning approach for language classification.

## Features

- Utilizes the TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert text data into numerical features based on TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- Implements a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for training the language detection model.
- Provides an interactive Jupyter Notebook environment for running the code and experimenting with different inputs.
- Handles missing values and performs data quality checks on the dataset using pandas and numpy libraries.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
- Calculates the accuracy of the model on the testing data as an evaluation metric.
- Demonstrates the ability to predict the language of a given text input using the trained model.
- Accesses a remote CSV file from a provided URL as the dataset source.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
